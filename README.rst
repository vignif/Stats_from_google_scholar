Crawler Google Scholar
--------

The crawler takes in input a file with the researchers whose information (i.e. # of publications, h-index, i10-index and others) 
are to be queried from google scholar, and fills it with the response from it.

Empirical solution can avoid the server to respond with [Error 429 Too Many Requests].
